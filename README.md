# SPR-CL-DI

This coding lab covers unit "Spring Boot", module "Spring Core". 

## Instructions
- This project contains classes that perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and squaring. 
- As with most Java applications, these classes contain dependencies on other classes.
- Using Spring annotations, inject the dependencies at the appropriate places so that all tests pass.
- Look out for @TODO statements to identify where annotations need to be placed.

## Shouldn't Modify (But Look at for Context)
- com.revature.components.Adder
- Test files

## Should Modify
- com.revature.components.Multiplier
- com.revature.components.Squarer
